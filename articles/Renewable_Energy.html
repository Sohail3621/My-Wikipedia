        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Renewable energy comes from sources that are naturally replenished, such as sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy produces minimal greenhouse gas emissions, making it a sustainable alternative.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Renewable Energy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> Harnesses sunlight using photovoltaic cells to generate electricity.</li>
            <li><strong>Wind Power:</strong> Uses wind turbines to convert wind energy into electricity.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydroelectric Power:</strong> Utilizes the energy of moving water, typically from dams, to generate power.</li>
            <li><strong>Geothermal Energy:</strong> Captures heat from the Earth's core to produce electricity and heating.</li>
            <li><strong>Biomass:</strong> Converts organic materials like wood, crops, and waste into energy.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Benefits of Renewable Energy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces greenhouse gas emissions, helping to combat climate change.</li>
            <li>Provides energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels.</li>
            <li>Creates new job opportunities in the renewable energy sector.</li>
            <li>Improves public health by reducing air and water pollution.</li>
            <li>Ensures a sustainable and long-term energy solution for future generations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Challenges and Future</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Energy Storage:</strong> Batteries and other storage technologies need improvement to store renewable energy efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Costs:</strong> Transitioning to renewable energy requires significant investment in new infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Intermittency Issues:</strong> Solar and wind energy depend on weather conditions, requiring backup solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> Research is ongoing to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness of renewable energy solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Renewable energy is a vital component of a sustainable future. With continued advancements in technology and infrastructure, it has the potential to replace fossil fuels and create a cleaner, more resilient energy system for the world.</p>

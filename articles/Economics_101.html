        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Economics is the study of how individuals, businesses, and governments allocate resources to satisfy their needs and wants. It involves analyzing production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.</p>
        
        <h2>Basic Economic Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supply and Demand:</strong> The relationship between the availability of goods and consumers' desire for them, determining prices.</li>
            <li><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong> The cost of forgoing the next best alternative when making a decision.</li>
            <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> The rise in prices of goods and services over time, reducing purchasing power.</li>
            <li><strong>GDP (Gross Domestic Product):</strong> The total value of all goods and services produced in a country within a specific period.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Types of Economic Systems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Economy:</strong> Economic decisions are driven by supply and demand with minimal government intervention.</li>
            <li><strong>Command Economy:</strong> The government controls production and distribution, often seen in socialist or communist systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed Economy:</strong> A blend of market and government-controlled economic policies, seen in most modern nations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Macroeconomics vs. Microeconomics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microeconomics:</strong> Focuses on individual businesses and consumer behaviors, analyzing supply and demand on a small scale.</li>
            <li><strong>Macroeconomics:</strong> Deals with national and global economic factors, including inflation, unemployment, and fiscal policies.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Key Economic Indicators</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> The percentage of people actively seeking work but unable to find employment.</li>
            <li><strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI):</strong> Measures the average change in prices of consumer goods and services.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> The cost of borrowing money, influenced by central banks to control inflation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Importance of Economics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Finance:</strong> Helps individuals manage income, expenses, savings, and investments.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Decisions:</strong> Companies use economic principles to set prices, wages, and production levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Government Policies:</strong> Governments rely on economic data to implement fiscal and monetary policies.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Challenges in Economics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Income Inequality:</strong> The growing wealth gap between different socio-economic classes.</li>
            <li><strong>Recessions:</strong> Periods of economic downturn, leading to job losses and reduced spending.</li>
            <li><strong>Globalization:</strong> Economic interdependence between countries, affecting trade and employment.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Economics is essential for understanding how financial decisions impact individuals, businesses, and governments. By applying economic principles, we can make informed choices and foster sustainable growth.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Programming languages are formal languages used to instruct computers to perform specific tasks. They form the backbone of software development and enable the creation of applications, websites, and artificial intelligence systems.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Programming Languages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Procedural Languages:</strong> Languages like C and Pascal follow a sequence of instructions to perform tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented Languages:</strong> Languages like Java, Python, and C++ organize code into reusable objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Functional Languages:</strong> Languages like Haskell and Lisp emphasize the use of functions and immutability.</li>
            <li><strong>Scripting Languages:</strong> Languages like JavaScript and Python are used for automating tasks and web development.</li>
            <li><strong>Markup and Query Languages:</strong> HTML and SQL are used for structuring web content and database queries.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Popular Programming Languages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> Known for its simplicity and versatility in web development, data science, and AI.</li>
            <li><strong>Java:</strong> Widely used for enterprise applications, mobile development (Android), and web applications.</li>
            <li><strong>C++:</strong> Popular in system programming, game development, and high-performance applications.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Essential for web development, enabling dynamic and interactive web pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Swift:</strong> Apple's programming language for iOS and macOS application development.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Advantages of Learning Programming Languages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhances problem-solving and logical thinking skills.</li>
            <li>Opens up career opportunities in software development, data science, and cybersecurity.</li>
            <li>Facilitates automation of repetitive tasks.</li>
            <li>Enables the development of websites, applications, and AI models.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Challenges in Programming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Syntax Complexity:</strong> Some languages have a steep learning curve.</li>
            <li><strong>Debugging Issues:</strong> Identifying and fixing errors can be time-consuming.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid Technological Changes:</strong> The programming landscape evolves quickly, requiring continuous learning.</li>
        </ul>

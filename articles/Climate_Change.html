        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns, primarily due to human activities such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation.</p>
        
        <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Increased carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) levels trap heat in the atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Reduces the ability of forests to absorb CO2, contributing to global warming.</li>
            <li><strong>Industrialization:</strong> Factories, transportation, and energy production release large amounts of pollutants.</li>
            <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Livestock farming and fertilizer use release methane and other greenhouse gases.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rising Temperatures:</strong> Global temperatures have increased significantly, leading to extreme weather conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Melting Ice Caps:</strong> Polar ice caps and glaciers are shrinking, contributing to rising sea levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Natural Disasters:</strong> More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves.</li>
            <li><strong>Threats to Biodiversity:</strong> Many species face extinction due to habitat loss and changing ecosystems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Solutions and Mitigation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Transitioning to solar, wind, and hydropower reduces dependence on fossil fuels.</li>
            <li><strong>Reforestation:</strong> Planting trees helps absorb CO2 and restore ecosystems.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Reducing energy consumption through better technology and conservation practices.</li>
            <li><strong>International Agreements:</strong> Global efforts like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global warming.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Urgent action is needed to mitigate its effects and protect the planet for future generations.</p>

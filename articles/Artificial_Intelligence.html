        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, reasoning, perception, and language understanding.</p>
        
        <h2>History of AI</h2>
        <p>The concept of AI dates back to ancient myths and philosophies about artificial beings endowed with intelligence. However, modern AI research began in the 1950s, with pioneers like Alan Turing and John McCarthy laying the foundation for machine learning and computational intelligence.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of AI</h2>
        <p>AI is broadly classified into three types: Narrow AI, which specializes in a single task (e.g., voice assistants); General AI, which can perform any intellectual task like a human; and Super AI, a theoretical form that surpasses human intelligence.</p>
        
        <h2>Applications of AI</h2>
        <p>AI is widely used in various industries, including healthcare (diagnostics and robotic surgery), finance (fraud detection and trading algorithms), autonomous vehicles, and customer service chatbots. Machine learning and deep learning are crucial AI techniques that enable systems to improve from experience.</p>
        
        <h2>Future of AI</h2>
        <p>As AI continues to evolve, ethical considerations such as data privacy, job displacement, and algorithmic bias remain important challenges. The future of AI holds promise in enhancing productivity, solving complex problems, and advancing scientific research.</p>

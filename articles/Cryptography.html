        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Cryptography is the practice of securing communication and data through the use of mathematical techniques. It is essential in ensuring privacy, security, and integrity in digital communications.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Cryptography</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symmetric Encryption:</strong> Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, DES).</li>
            <li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption:</strong> Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (e.g., RSA, ECC).</li>
            <li><strong>Hash Functions:</strong> Convert data into a fixed-length hash, ensuring data integrity (e.g., SHA-256, MD5).</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Authenticate the sender and verify message integrity using cryptographic keys.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Applications of Cryptography</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Used in HTTPS, VPNs, and encrypted messaging applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Ensures data privacy in cloud storage and databases.</li>
            <li><strong>Blockchain Technology:</strong> Cryptographic algorithms secure transactions in blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Systems:</strong> Used in password hashing, digital certificates, and multi-factor authentication.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>History of Cryptography</h2>
        <p>Cryptography has evolved from simple substitution ciphers used by ancient civilizations to complex algorithms securing modern digital systems. Some key milestones include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Caesar Cipher:</strong> A simple shift cipher used by Julius Caesar to encode messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Enigma Machine:</strong> Used by the Germans during World War II and later decrypted by Allied cryptographers.</li>
            <li><strong>Public-Key Cryptography:</strong> Introduced in the 1970s, revolutionizing secure communication.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Challenges and Future of Cryptography</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quantum Computing Threats:</strong> Future quantum computers may break current encryption methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Quantum Cryptography:</strong> Researchers are developing encryption methods resistant to quantum attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> Governments and organizations debate encryption backdoors and data access.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Cryptography is vital for securing digital communications and protecting sensitive information. As technology evolves, so do encryption methods, ensuring ongoing security against emerging threats.</p>

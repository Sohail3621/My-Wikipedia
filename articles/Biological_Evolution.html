        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Biological evolution refers to the gradual change in the characteristics of species over generations through natural selection, genetic drift, and other evolutionary mechanisms.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Concepts of Evolution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Selection:</strong> Proposed by Charles Darwin, it suggests that organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.</li>
            <li><strong>Genetic Variation:</strong> Differences in DNA among individuals of a population, which can lead to evolutionary changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Mutation:</strong> Random changes in genetic material that can introduce new traits.</li>
            <li><strong>Speciation:</strong> The process by which new species evolve from existing ones due to genetic divergence.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Evidence for Evolution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fossil Record:</strong> Shows changes in species over millions of years.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparative Anatomy:</strong> Similar structures in different species (homologous structures) suggest common ancestry.</li>
            <li><strong>Genetic Evidence:</strong> DNA comparisons reveal evolutionary relationships between organisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Embryology:</strong> Similar embryonic development across species points to shared ancestry.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Major Evolutionary Events</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Origin of Life:</strong> Around 3.5 billion years ago, simple life forms emerged in the oceans.</li>
            <li><strong>Cambrian Explosion:</strong> A period of rapid diversification of life about 540 million years ago.</li>
            <li><strong>Extinction Events:</strong> Several mass extinctions, such as the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, have shaped evolutionary history.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Evolution:</strong> Homo sapiens evolved from primate ancestors over millions of years.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Impact of Evolution on Modern Science</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> Understanding evolution helps in studying antibiotic resistance and genetic diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Ecology:</strong> Evolutionary principles guide conservation efforts and species protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial Selection:</strong> Humans selectively breed plants and animals for desirable traits.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Challenges and Debates</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Misconceptions:</strong> Some misunderstand evolution as a process of goal-oriented improvement rather than natural changes over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Religious and Cultural Beliefs:</strong> Evolutionary theory sometimes conflicts with certain religious perspectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Research:</strong> Scientists continue to explore new aspects of evolutionary mechanisms and their implications.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Biological evolution is a fundamental concept in science, explaining the diversity of life on Earth. Ongoing research continues to deepen our understanding of how life evolves and adapts.</p>

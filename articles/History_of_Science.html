        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The history of science is the study of the development of science and scientific knowledge, including both natural and social sciences. Science as a discipline has its origins in ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, China, and Greece. Over time, scientific discoveries and methodologies evolved, leading to the technological advancements we see today.</p>
        
        <h2>Ancient Science</h2>
        <p>In ancient times, scientific knowledge was intertwined with philosophy and religion. The Babylonians and Egyptians developed mathematics and astronomy, while Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Plato laid the foundation for logical reasoning and empirical observation.</p>
        
        <h2>The Scientific Revolution</h2>
        <p>During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Scientific Revolution transformed human understanding of the natural world. Figures like Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton introduced new models of the universe and physics, emphasizing observation and experimentation over speculation.</p>
        
        <h2>Modern Science</h2>
        <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, scientific fields became more specialized. Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, Einstein’s theory of relativity, and the development of quantum mechanics revolutionized physics and biology. Advances in medicine, chemistry, and engineering have continued to shape the modern world.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The history of science is a testament to human curiosity and ingenuity. From ancient observations to cutting-edge research, science continues to evolve, shaping our understanding of the universe and improving our quality of life.</p>

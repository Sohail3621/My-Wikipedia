        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a fundamental branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy on very small scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It challenges classical physics by introducing concepts such as wave-particle duality, superposition, and quantum entanglement.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <p>Quantum mechanics introduces several key principles: the uncertainty principle, quantum states, and probability wave functions. Unlike classical physics, where particles have definite positions and velocities, quantum particles exist in multiple states until measured.</p>
        
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>Quantum physics has led to numerous technological advancements, including semiconductors, quantum computing, cryptography, and medical imaging (MRI). Quantum computers, still in development, promise to revolutionize problem-solving capabilities.</p>
        
        <h2>Challenges and Future</h2>
        <p>Despite its success, quantum mechanics remains a complex and sometimes counterintuitive field. Researchers continue to explore ways to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, which governs gravity at cosmic scales.</p>

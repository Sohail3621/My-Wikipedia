        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Music theory is the study of the principles that govern the structure, composition, and performance of music. It includes concepts such as notation, scales, chords, harmony, melody, rhythm, and musical form.</p>
        
        <h2>Fundamental Concepts</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Musical Notation</h3>
        <p>Musical notation is a system of symbols used to represent pitch, rhythm, and dynamics in music. It consists of notes, rests, clefs, time signatures, and other symbols.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Scales and Keys</h3>
        <p>A scale is a series of notes arranged in ascending or descending order. The most common types are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Major Scale:</strong> A happy and bright-sounding scale.</li>
            <li><strong>Minor Scale:</strong> A darker and more emotional scale.</li>
            <li><strong>Chromatic Scale:</strong> Includes all twelve notes in an octave.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keys are determined by the tonic note and the scale used, forming the foundation of harmony in music.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Chords and Harmony</h3>
        <p>Chords are combinations of three or more notes played simultaneously. Harmony refers to how chords interact within a piece. Some common chords include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Major Chords:</strong> Bright and stable sounding.</li>
            <li><strong>Minor Chords:</strong> Melancholic and emotional.</li>
            <li><strong>Dominant Chords:</strong> Create tension, leading to resolution.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Rhythm and Meter</h3>
        <p>Rhythm is the pattern of sounds and silences in music, while meter organizes beats into measures. Common time signatures include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4/4 (Common Time):</strong> Four beats per measure.</li>
            <li><strong>3/4 (Waltz Time):</strong> Three beats per measure.</li>
            <li><strong>6/8 (Compound Time):</strong> Six beats per measure, often used in folk and classical music.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5. Musical Form</h3>
        <p>Musical form refers to the structure of a piece of music. Some common forms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Form (AB):</strong> Two contrasting sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Ternary Form (ABA):</strong> A returning first section after a contrasting middle section.</li>
            <li><strong>Sonata Form:</strong> A complex structure used in classical music.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Importance of Music Theory</h2>
        <p>Understanding music theory helps musicians read, write, and analyze music effectively. It enhances creativity and allows for better communication among performers and composers.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Music theory is essential for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of music. It provides the foundation for composition, improvisation, and performance across various musical genres.</p>

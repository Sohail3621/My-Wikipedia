        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, theft, and damage. It encompasses a range of technologies, processes, and practices designed to safeguard information and ensure online safety.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Aspects of Cybersecurity</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Network Security</h3>
        <p>Network security involves protecting a computer network from intruders, whether attackers from outside or malicious insiders. Common measures include firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Information Security</h3>
        <p>Information security focuses on protecting data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. Techniques like encryption and access controls help maintain data integrity and confidentiality.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Application Security</h3>
        <p>Application security ensures that software and applications are secure from threats. This includes practices such as secure coding, regular software updates, and vulnerability assessments.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Endpoint Security</h3>
        <p>Endpoint security involves securing devices like computers, mobile phones, and tablets from cyber threats. Antivirus software, firewalls, and mobile device management (MDM) tools are commonly used.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Cloud Security</h3>
        <p>As more businesses move to cloud computing, cloud security focuses on protecting data stored in cloud environments. Encryption, identity management, and multi-factor authentication are key strategies.</p>
        
        <h2>Common Cyber Threats</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.</li>
            <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software such as viruses, worms, and ransomware that can harm systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Overloading a network or service to make it unavailable to users.</li>
            <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:</strong> Intercepting communication between two parties to steal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero-Day Exploits:</strong> Attacks that target previously unknown vulnerabilities in software.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Best Practices for Cybersecurity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Ensure passwords are long, unique, and regularly updated.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Software Updates:</strong> Keeping software and operating systems up to date to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Backups:</strong> Regularly back up critical data to prevent data loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Educate Users:</strong> Awareness training to recognize and prevent cyber threats.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity is essential in the digital age, protecting individuals and organizations from cyber threats. By implementing strong security measures and staying informed about emerging risks, we can ensure a safer online environment.</p>

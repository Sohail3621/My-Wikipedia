        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Throughout history, scientists have played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of the natural world. Their discoveries and inventions have transformed medicine, physics, chemistry, and many other fields, impacting human civilization in profound ways.</p>
        
        <h2>Notable Scientists and Their Contributions</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Albert Einstein (1879-1955)</h3>
        <p>Developed the theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. His famous equation, E=mcÂ², laid the foundation for nuclear energy.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Isaac Newton (1643-1727)</h3>
        <p>Formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which became the cornerstone of classical mechanics. His work in optics and calculus also had a significant impact on science.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Marie Curie (1867-1934)</h3>
        <p>Pioneered research on radioactivity, becoming the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She discovered the elements polonium and radium, leading to advancements in cancer treatment.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Charles Darwin (1809-1882)</h3>
        <p>Proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection in his work "On the Origin of Species." His findings reshaped biology and our understanding of life's diversity.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Nikola Tesla (1856-1943)</h3>
        <p>Developed the alternating current (AC) electrical system, which powers modern electricity grids. He also contributed to radio technology and wireless energy transmission.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)</h3>
        <p>Often called the "father of modern science," he made significant advancements in astronomy, physics, and engineering. His telescopic observations confirmed the heliocentric model of the solar system.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Stephen Hawking (1942-2018)</h3>
        <p>Known for his work on black holes and the nature of the universe, he introduced the concept of Hawking radiation, which describes how black holes can lose mass.</p>
        
        <h3>8. Louis Pasteur (1822-1895)</h3>
        <p>Developed the germ theory of disease and created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax. His work led to pasteurization, a method of killing bacteria in food and drink.</p>
        
        <h3>9. Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958)</h3>
        <p>Contributed to the discovery of DNA's double-helix structure through X-ray crystallography, paving the way for modern genetics.</p>
        
        <h3>10. Alan Turing (1912-1954)</h3>
        <p>Laid the groundwork for modern computing and artificial intelligence. His work in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II greatly influenced cryptography and computer science.</p>
